## How to develop

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

module is now available at `dist/index.mjs`

// notes regarding usage

-   source index.mjs contains the API formatting code
-   in source, the main composer and screen constant/component exist, but the sub components for each were not made clear yet
-   in source, the layout compwidegt onent does exist - I didn't know if the framework necessarily needed it though
