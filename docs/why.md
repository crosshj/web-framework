# Why is Anthroware building a framework

The framework is a try to simplify the way we build digital products, by building a simple and generic front end engine that is able to render screens without having to write them declaratively.

By achieving that, a team is able to use the same engine in a different project, needing only to:

1. update theme with new brand definitions
2. fix whatever is needed on the components

Then, it's time to work out the screens and layouts, which are truly specific to that project, and not generic stuff that could be skipped.
