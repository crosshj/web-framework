#Screens

In this framework, screens are mostly just a bit of configuration that relates its name to a specific layout and more info, when needed.

```
const myModuleScreens = {
  screen1: {
    layout: 'layoutTypeHere',
  },
  screen2: {
    layout: 'anotherLayoutTypeHere',
    someInfo: 'someInfoHere'
  }
}
```
